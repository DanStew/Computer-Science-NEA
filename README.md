This is my A Level Computer Science NEA
It is a football league table and fixture generation system made using HTML, CSS and Javascript
It allows the user to be able to create either a knockout or a round robin tournament
Fixtures will then be generated for the tournament they create
Lastly, the user will be able to input results and the effects of these results will be displayed to the user

The project has now been completed, however there are some errors and the website isn't fully functional
